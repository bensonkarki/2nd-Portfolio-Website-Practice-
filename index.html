          <p class="intro">My name is Benson Karki and I am a 16-year-old going into my senior year of high school. My current hobbies are working on beginner front-end projects and courses, reselling sneakers, and lifting weights. I have interests in personal finance, YouTube, Twitch streaming, online businesses, music, and more. I am a determined person and work hard in school and with my own goals.</p>
